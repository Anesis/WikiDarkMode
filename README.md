# Wikipedia Dark Theme

## Introduction

Wikipedia Dark Theme is a script to give wikipedia pages a black color theme.  
I use wikipedia a lot, the white background really bugs me much. Especially after staring at a dark IDE for some time.  
Hence I made a Javascript to solve it.  
_Note: using this script will affect page loading speed._

## Installation

The script requires **Tampermonkey** - an extension available on most web browsers.  
To install:

* Click the `Wikipedia Dark Theme.user.js` file.

* Click the `Raw` button on the file's top right corner.

* An install page should pop up automatically.
